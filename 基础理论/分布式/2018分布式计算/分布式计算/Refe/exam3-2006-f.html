<h1>Distributed Systems</h1>
<h2>Exam 3 Fall 2006</h2>
<ol>
<h1>Part I - 40 points</h1>

<li>  8 points <br>
How do you validate a digital signature (for example, in signed software) against a message using an X.509 digital certificate?

</li><li>  8 points <br> Both Kerberos and SSL use symmetric
cryptography for communication. Contrast the way a recipient gets a
session key when using Kerberos versus when using SSL.
</li><li>  6 points <br> 
What are the three factors of authentication?
        <ol>
        <li>     _________________________________________________
        </li><li>       _________________________________________________
        </li><li>        _________________________________________________
        </li></ol>

</li><li>  6 points <br>
The Diffie-Hellman algorithm is not an encryption algorithm. What is it good for?

</li><li>  6 points <br>
What is a nonce and how is it used in authentication algorithms?

</li><li>  6 points <br>
Why is it advisable for application proxies to run on dual-homed hosts?

<h1>PART II - 60 points - 4 points each </h1>

For each statement, select the most appropriate answer.

</li><li>   The two phases in two-phase locking are:
        <br> (a) Phase 1: request lock; Phase 2: get a lock grant.
        <br> (b) Phase 1: grab a tentative lock; Phase 2: get a lock confirmation.
        <br> (c) Phase 1: get all locks; Phase 2: release all locks.
        <br> (d) Phase 1: revoke all remote locks for the resource; Phase 2: get a lock for the resource.

</li><li>   Which is not  a form of concurrency control?
        <br> (a) Two-phase locking.
        <br> (b) Two-version locking.
        <br> (c) Exclusive locks.
        <br> (d) Timestamp ordering.

</li><li>   A write-ahead log is important in a two-phase commit protocol because:
        <br> (a) It allows auditors to examine the transactions.
        <br> (b) It ensures all-or-nothing atomicity.
        <br> (c) It allows a system to recover its state in the protocol if it died.
        <br> (d) It reduces message traffic since all participants can reference the same write-ahead log file.

</li><li>   A pair of mirrored disks is an example of:
        <br> (a) Information redundancy
        <br> (b) Time redundancy.
        <br> (c) Physical redundancy.
        <br> (d) Triple modular redundancy.
</li><li>   TCP/IP achieves fault tolerance through:
        <br> (a) Information redundancy.
        <br> (b) Time redundancy.
        <br> (c) Physical redundancy.
        <br> (d) Triple modular redundancy.
</li><li>   SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is an example of a:
        <br> (a) Hybrid cryptosystem.
        <br> (b) Two-party system using symmetric cryptography.
        <br> (c) Three-party system using symmetric cryptography and a third-party arbiter.
        <br> (d) A public key system.
</li><li>   In chaffing &amp; winnowing, a recipient has to:
        <br> (a) Sort out good messages from bad ones.
        <br> (b) Identify the relevant parts of a message.
        <br> (c) Use a null cipher to extract the message.
        <br> (d) Employ a transform (such as a discrete cosine transform) on the data to extract the message.
</li><li>   Which system was designed to fend off automated software for web-based registration forms?
        <br> (a) OTP
        <br> (b) CAPTCHA
        <br> (c) IPSEC
        <br> (d) Kerberos
</li><li>   Which of the following is not a technique for penetrating computer systems?
        <br> (a) Dictionary attacks.
        <br> (b) Network address translation.
        <br> (c) Social engineering. 
        <br> (d) Buffer overflow.
</li><li>   A system or service that is set up speci?cally to trap intruders is a:
        <br> (a) demilitarized zone.
        <br> (b) honeypot.
        <br> (c) denial of service attack.
        <br> (d) ping of death.
</li><li>   Stateful inspection in a packet filter will not :
        <br> (a) Keep track of TCP/IP connections.
        <br> (b) Detect buffer overflow attempts.
        <br> (c) Allow port triggering.
        <br> (d) Limit rates of SYN packets.
</li><li>   Which failover is easiest to implement?
        <br> (a) Cold.
        <br> (b) Warm.
        <br> (c) Hot.
        <br> (d) Synchrnous.
</li><li>   Which of the following is a protocol for VPNs?
        <br> (a) PPP
        <br> (b) IPSEC
        <br> (c) IPX
        <br> (d) NetBEUI
</li><li>   A Virtual Machine Manager (VMM):
        <br> (a) Intercepts privileged instructions.
        <br> (b) Manages a collection of multiple machines to create the illusion of a single system.
        <br> (c) Simulates a machine by emulating all opcodes of a virtual machine.
        <br> (d) Emulates one or more operating systems.
