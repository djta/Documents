</sp></sp></li><li>8 points <br>
(a) How does read-ahead help improve remote file system performance?

(b) When does read-ahead not improve remote file system performance?


</li><li>5 points<br>
Explain what is meant by a stateless file system.


</li><li>5 points<br>
Why may opening a file under Coda be less efficient than under AFS?


</li><li>5 points<br>
Explain <i>reliable multicast</i>.


</li><li>9 points<br>
When its clock reads 3:42:07.100, a client sends a time request
message to a server and gets a response back at 3:42:07.125. The
response contains a server timestamp of 3:42:07.125.

(a) Using Cristian's algorithm, to what value does the client set its clock?

(b) If the best-case round-trip time is 20 msec., what is the error
of the synchronized clock? [N.B.: 1000 msec = 1 second]

(c) If the clock was last synchronized 1000 seconds ago, what is
the drift based on your synchronization (in milliseconds per second)?

<h1>Part II - 60 Points</h1>

For each statement, select the <i>most</i> appropriate answer.

</li><li> A serializable class in Java:
        <br>(a) guarantees that an object is reference by only one thread at a time.
        <br>(b) ensures that valid remote references can be created for that object.
        <br>(c) allows remote object references to be registered with the rmiregistry name server.
        <br>(d) ensures that the object can be marshaled into a network message.



</li><li>       Compared to a remote procedure model, an upload/download model is more likely to:
        <br>(a) provide session semantics.
        <br>(b) use a stateless architecture.
        <br>(c) use remote procedure calls.
        <br>(d) be implemented as a separate file system type on the client.

</li><li>       Which of the following is not a remote procedure call under NFS?
        <br>(a) write (write to a file)
        <br>(b) close (close a file)
        <br>(c) mkdir (create a directory)
        <br>(d) statfs (get information for the file system)

</li><li>       Which statement is not accurate about AFS?
        <br>(a) AFS provides session semantics. 
        <br>(b) AFS volumes can issue referrals when a resource moves.
        <br>(c) AFS does not consume disk space on the client.
        <br>(d) AFS resources are allocated in units called volumes.

</li><li>       Which statement is not accurate about Coda?
        <br>(a) Replicated servers constitute a volume storage group.
        <br>(b) Coda supports session semantics.
        <br>(c) File updates are logged to a client modification log when a client is disconnected.
        <br>(d) Replicated servers initiate a resolution process to synchronize their contents.

</li><li>       Tokens in DFS (AFS version 3):
        <br>(a) allow the server to control caching behavior on clients.
        <br>(b) represent resources and are circulated from machine to machine.
        <br>(c) allow a machine to ensure that all other machines are alive.
        <br>(d) provide a way to meter traffic to the server.

</li><li>       A persistent write-ahead log is important for:
        <br>(a) providing an audit trail.
        <br>(b) optimizing remote file system access.
        <br>(c) ensuring that a transaction remembers its state even upon reboot.
        <br>(d) allowing a client to play back file operations upon reconnection.

</li><li>       The wait-die algorithm:
        <br>(a) detects deadlock by having nodes send resource usage information to a coordinator.
        <br>(b) detects deadlock by sending a probe message prior to requesting a resource.
        <br>(c) does not allow a younger process to take resources held by an older one.
        <br>(d) allows a process to wait for a resource to become free and then kill itself if the resource does not become available.

</li><li>       Lamport timestamps can easily be modified to:
        <br>(a) provide global ordering.
        <br>(b) provide total ordering.
        <br>(c) detect concurrency among events.
        <br>(d) provide proper ordering among causally related events.

</li><li>       Which mutual exclusion algorithm does not require group members to know all the members of the group?
        <br>(a) Centralized
        <br>(b) Token ring
        <br>(c) Ricart &amp; Agrawala
        <br>(d) Lamport

</li><li> What is an efficient and scalable way for a node to find all
cached copies of a given page in a distributed shared memory system? <br>(a)    Centralized directory
        <br>(b) Distributed directory
        <br>(c) Multicast page query
        <br>(d) Broadcast page query

</li><li>       Entry consistency:
        <br>(a) is the opposite of release consistency: changes are propagated in the acquire phase.
        <br>(b) propagates invalidations and updates anytime after the release phase.
        <br>(c) cannot use the memory management unit effectively to detect changes to memory.
        <br>(d) must be implemented for release consistency to work properly.

</li><li>       A more practical approach to global time ordering is:
        <br>(a) sync ordering.
        <br>(b) total ordering.
        <br>(c) causal ordering.
        <br>(d) local ordering.
