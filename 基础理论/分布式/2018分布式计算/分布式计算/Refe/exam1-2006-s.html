<h1>Part II - 75 Points</h1>

<p>
For each statement, select the <i>most</i> appropriate answer.
</p>

</li><li> Multiprocessor systems are characterized by:
        <br>(a) shared memory.
        <br>(b) a high-speed processor-to-processor interconnect.
        <br>(c) a crossbar switch.
        <br>(d) All of the above.

</li><li> Ethernet is best characterized as:
        <br>(a) a packet-based baseband network.
        <br>(b) a packet-based broadband network.
        <br>(c) a virtual-circuit-based baseband network.
        <br>(d) a virtual-circuit-based broadband network.

</li><li> A snoopy cache reduces bus traffic for:
        <br>(a) memory read operations.
        <br>(b) both memory read and write operations.
        <br>(c) memory write operations.
        <br>(d) neither memory read nor write operations.

</li><li> The portmapper under Sun (ONC) RPC:
        <br>(a) allocates ports to server processes that host RPC functions.
        <br>(b) allocates ports to clients that use RPC.
        <br>(c) maps external port numbers to internal ones to allow Internet access to RPC services.
        <br>(d) allows clients that use RPC to look up the port number of a server that hosts RPC functions.

</li><li> You have 100 machines in your network. How many IP addresses
are saved (i.e., not wasted) by switching to a CIDR /25 network instead
of a class C (/24) network? <br>(a)     None (0).
        <br>(b) 26.
        <br>(c) 128.
        <br>(d) 154.

</li><li> The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):
        <br>(a) ﬁnds the IP address corresponding to a host name.
        <br>(b) ﬁnds the MAC (e.g., ethernet) address corresponding to an IP address.
        <br>(c) resolves the route to the destination host.
        <br>(d) ﬁnds the IP address corresponding to a MAC (e.g., ethernet) address.

</li><li> Which of the following does not address quality of service for packet delivery on an IP network?
        <br>(a) Differentiated services (Diff-Serv) using the ToS field of an IP header.
        <br>(b) RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol).
        <br>(c) IP flow detection in routers.
        <br>(d) RSVP (ReserVation Protocol).

</li><li> Which of the following best describes how an ethernet controller sends packets onto the network?
        <br>(a) It transmits whenever it is has data and then checks whether there was a collision with another transmitter.
        <br>(b) It transmits only within its prescribed time slot, thus avoiding collisions with other transmitters.
        <br>(c) It arbitrates for exclusive access to the network and then transmits the packet.
        <br>(d)
It checks the network for traffic and, when free, attempts to transmit
and then checks if the transmission succeeded without interference.
</li><li> Select the most accurate statement about TCP and UDP. 
        <br>(a) TCP is a transport layer (4) protocol while UDP is a network layer (3) protocol.
        <br>(b) UDP causes data to be transmitted over the network in packets while TCP sends a data stream over a pre-established circuit.
        <br>(c) TCP contains software to ensure packets are delivered to the application in-order while UDP does not.
        <br>(d) UDP is a user-level service while TCP resides in the kernel.

</li><li> A protocol control block (PCB):
        <br>(a) Selects the
appropriate network protocol for an incoming packet based on the local
address, local port, foreign address, and foreign port. <br>(b) directs data to the appropriate socket based on a
combination of source address, source port, destination address, and
destination port. <br>(c)       provides a layer of abstraction that makes socket-based communication network-agnostic.
        <br>(d) ensures in-order delivery by indexing data by local address, local port, foreign addres, and foreign port.

</li><li> Which of the following addresses does not belong to the network 2.12.4.0/18?
        <br>(a) 2.12.3.12
        <br>(b) 2.12.7.1
        <br>(c) 2.12.8.121
        <br>(d) 2.12.10.6

</li><li> What is the primary use of a DNS referral?
        <br>(a) Managing addresses of systems that have moved outside the domain.
        <br>(b) Managing addresses of systems that have moved within the domain.
        <br>(c) Translating between aliases of machine names and the actual name.
        <br>(d) Identifying a name server that is closer to the requested domain.

</li><li> Which of the following tasks is not the responsibility of an IP driver?
        <br>(a) Routing packets.
        <br>(b) Fragmenting packets.
        <br>(c) Dropping expired packets.
        <br>(d) Receiving packets from the network interface.

</li><li> The Domain Name Service (DNS):
        <br>(a) finds the IP address corresponding to a host name.
        <br>(b) finds the MAC (e.g., ethernet) address corresponding to an IP address..
        <br>(c) resolves the route to the destination host.
        <br>(d) finds the IP address corresponding to a MAC (e.g., ethernet) address.

</li><li> DCE enhanced Sun (ONC) RPC by adding:
        <br>(a) an interface definition language.
        <br>(b) a centralized name server.
        <br>(c) an interface pointer identifier.
        <br>(d) support for polymorphism.
