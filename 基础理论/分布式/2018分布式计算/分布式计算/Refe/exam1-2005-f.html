<h1> Distributed Systems </h1>

<ol>
<h1>Part I - 40 Points</h1>

<li> 7 points<br>
You need to set up a network of 40,000 machines on the Internet.
Using class-based addressing, you would need a class B network. Its
16-bit host address will allow addressing over 65,000 hosts, leading
to over 25,000 unused addresses. Will CIDR help? If yes, explain
how. If not, explain why not.


</li><li>7 points <br>
In what way does the operating system have to play a role in a NUMA
(Non-Uniform Memory Access) architecture?


</li><li>6 points<br>
How does DCE RPC add an extra layer of transparency over Sun (ONC) RPC?


</li><li>6 points<br>
What is the purpose of a port number in TCP and UDP?


</li><li>6 points<br>
Explain the purpose of an IDL in RPC.

(a) What is an advantage of late binding over early binding?
<br><sp>
(b) What is an advantage of early binding over late binding?

</sp><h1>Part II - 60 Points</h1>

For each statement, select the <i>most</i> appropriate answer.

</li><li> A serializable class in Java:
        <br>(a) guarantees that an object is reference by only one thread at a time.
        <br>(b) ensures that valid remote references can be created for that object.
        <br>(c) allows remote object references to be registered with the rmiregistry name server.
        <br>(d) ensures that the object can be marshaled into a network message.

</li><li> A TCP header does not contain a
        <br>(a) checksum.
        <br>(b) sequence number.
        <br>(c) timestamp.
        <br>(d) source port.

</li><li> The portmapper under Sun (ONC) RPC:
        <br>(a) allocates ports to server processes that host RPC functions.
        <br>(b) allocates ports to clients that use RPC.
        <br>(c) maps external port numbers to internal ones to allow Internet access to RPC services.
        <br>(d) allows clients that use RPC to look up the port number of a server that hosts RPC functions.

</li><li> Which answer most accurately reflects the positions of TCP and UDP on the OSI protocol stack:
        <br>(a) TCP: network (layer 3) UDP: network (layer 3).
        <br>(b) TCP: network (layer 3) UDP: transport (layer 4).
        <br>(c) TCP: transport (layer 4) UDP: network (layer 3).
        <br>(d) TCP: transport (layer 4) UDP: transport (layer 4).

</li><li> The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):
        <br>(a) finds the IP address corresponding to a host name.
        <br>(b) finds the MAC (e.g., ethernet) address corresponding to an IP address.
        <br>(c) resolves the route to the destination host.
        <br>(d) finds the IP address corresponding to a MAC (e.g., ethernet) address.

</li><li> Which of the following is not true about Microsoft ORPC?
        <br>(a) It uses an interface definition language.
        <br>(b) Clients send requests to increment a remote reference.
        <br>(c) Servers periodically send a ping set of all remote references to the client.
        <br>(d) It supports an interface pointer identifier.

</li><li> DCE RPC enhanced Sun (ONC) RPC by:
        <br>(a) Introducing remote reference counting.
        <br>(b) Adding support for objects.
        <br>(c) Introducing a unique ID number to identify remote services.
        <br>(d) Using XML to marshal requests.

</li><li> How does ARP ensure that responses to ARP queries come from the proper host?
        <br>(a) The query is sent only to the proper machine.
        <br>(b) The query is made over an encrypted connection.
        <br>(c) The response contains a checksum.
        <br>(d) There is no mechanism to ensure that the response comes from the proper host.

</li><li> Microsoft .NET does not use:
        <br>(a) XIDL (eXtensible Interface Definition Language)
        <br>(b) SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
        <br>(c) WSDL (Web Service Definition Language)
        <br>(d) HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol)

</li><li> Which of the following addresses does not belong to the network 1.15.8.0/22?
        <br>(a) 1.15.10.5
        <br>(b) 1.15.11.101
        <br>(c) 1.15.9.15
        <br>(d) 1.15.12.2

</li><li> The Domain Name Service (DNS):
        <br>(a) finds the IP address corresponding to a host name.
        <br>(b) finds the MAC (e.g., ethernet) address corresponding to an IP address..
        <br>(c) resolves the route to the destination host.
        <br>(d) finds the IP address corresponding to a MAC (e.g., ethernet) address.

</li><li> TCP provides the following advantage over UDP:
        <br>(a) It consumes fewer resources by not maintaining connection state.
        <br>(b) It regulates the rate at which packets enter the network to reduce congestion.
        <br>(c) It sends the source address and port number so the to identify the origin of the packet.
        <br>(d) It provides a mechanism to retransmit missing or dropped packets.
