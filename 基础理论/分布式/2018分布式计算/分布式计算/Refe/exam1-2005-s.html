<h2> Exam 1 - Spring 2005</h2>

<ol>
<h1>Part I - 35 Points</h1>

<li> 8 points<br>

Is baseband communications ever preferable to broadband? Explain.


</li><li>7 points <br>
Give an example of a case where cache coherence would be broken in a system where the 
cache controllers have snooping but do not have write-through.


</li><li>5 points<br>
Explain what is meant by parameter marshaling in remote procedure calls.


</li><li>12 points <br>
Explain how each of the following helped keep the Internet from running out of addresses. 
Note: this question is not asking you to define CIDR, NAT, or DHCP.
<br>(a) CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):
<br>(b) NAT (Network Address Translation):
<br>(c) DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):


</li><li> 8 points <br>
What two techniques does Microsoft use for distributed garbage collection in DCOM?
<br>(1) 
<br>(2)


<h1>Part II - 65 Points</h1>

For each statement, select the <i>most</i> appropriate answer.


</li><li>       A multiprocessor system is defined as having:
        <br>(a) shared memory.
        <br>(b) a high-speed processor interconnect.
        <br>(c) a single system image.
        <br>(d) a communication network between the computers.

</li><li>       Which processor-memory interconnect exhibits the best performance in a multiprocessor 
system?
        <br>(a) Bus.
        <br>(b) Crossbar.
        <br>(c) Omega network.
        <br>(d) NUMA.

</li><li>       Thin clients are characterized by:
        <br>(a) a small amount of software on the client with most work performed on the server.
        <br>(b) standalone machines that don't need a server to function.
        <br>(c) machines with lightweight communications protocols.
        <br>(d) a high-speed interconnect between the client and server.

</li><li>       CSMA/CD:
        <br>(a) allows multiple machines to send messages simultaneously.
        <br>(b) allows one machine to send multiple messages simultaneously.
        <br>(c) ensures that a single machine can send a message reliably.
        <br>(d) provides a way for a machine to send a message but it may have to be retransmitted.

</li><li>       The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):
        <br>(a) finds the IP address corresponding to a host name.
        <br>(b) finds the MAC (e.g., ethernet) address corresponding to an IP address..
        <br>(c) resolves the route to the destination host.
        <br>(d) finds the IP address corresponding to a MAC (e.g., ethernet) address.

</li><li>       What data delivery is most suitable for file transfer (e.g., via FTP)?
        <br>(a) Asynchronous.
        <br>(b) Synchronous.
        <br>(c) Isochronous.
        <br>(d) Bisynchronous.

</li><li>       In connection-oriented protocols:
        <br>(a) the client is not positive whether the message arrived at the destination.
        <br>(b) messages are guaranteed to arrive in order.
        <br>(c) there is no need to terminate the connection.
        <br>(d) the transport is cheaper but less reliable than via virtual circuit service.

</li><li>       DCE RPC enhanced Sun (ONC) RPC with:
        <br>(a) a name server on the server.
        <br>(b) an object pointer data type.
        <br>(c) an interface definition language.
        <br>(d) a unique ID generator.

</li><li>       The portmapper:
        <br>(a) directs incoming packets to the correct port.
        <br>(b) allows a client to find the port for a specific RPC interface.
        <br>(c) associates a port number with a socket.
        <br>(d) allows multiple processes to share the same port.

</li><li>       Creating a Java ServerSocket does not use the following system call?
        <br>(a) socket
        <br>(b) bind
        <br>(c) accept
        <br>(d) listen

</li><li>       The pitfall of CIDR is that:
        <br>(a) one has to manage prefixes as well as addresses.
        <br>(b) global backbone Internet routers are approaching their limit.
        <br>(c) it leads to inefficient route aggregation.
        <br>(d) both (b) and (c).

</li><li>       The Domain Name Service (DNS):
        <br>(a) finds the IP address corresponding to a host name.
        <br>(b) finds the MAC (e.g., ethernet) address corresponding to an IP address..
        <br>(c) resolves the route to the destination host.
        <br>(d) finds the IP address corresponding to a MAC (e.g., ethernet) address.
