<h1>Distributed Systems</h1>
<h2>Exam 2 Spring 2006 </h2> 

<ol>
<h1>Part I - 25 Points</h1>

<li> 5 points <br>
Why is Coda not well suited to hosting a shared database?

</li><li> 6 points <br>
When does an AFS client get an updated copy of a file that was modified on another system?

</li><li> 6 points <br>
CIFS supports a SEEK command, which sets the current read/write
position in the file. NFS does not have this. Is this a deficiency in
NFS? Explain.
</li><li> 6 points <br>
What is <em>false deadlock</em>?

</li><li> 5 points <br>
What is <em>false sharing</em>?

</li><li> 6 points <br>
Assign Lamport timestamps to the following events:

<table>
<tbody><tr> <td> a. </td> <td width="50"> &nbsp; </td> 
     <td> d. </td> <td width="50"> &nbsp; </td> </tr>

     <td> e. </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>

</li><li> 6 points<br>
You have a several computers cooperating on a parallel program. CPU
1 tries to write to page 302, which is currently owned by CPU 0.
Explain the sequence of operations that takes place.

<h1>Part II - 60 Points</h1>

<p>
For each statement, select the <i>most</i> appropriate answer.
</p>
</li><li> Which of the following is not a valid NFS v3 RPC:
        <br> ACCESS: check access permissions.
        <br> CLOSE: close a file.
        <br> MKNOD: create a special device file.
        <br> GETATTR: get file attributes.
</li><li> Oplocks are designed to:
        <br> control server-side caching.
        <br> control client-side caching.
        <br> allow clients to perform advisory file locking.
        <br> ensure that only one client accesses a file at a time.
</li><li> The NFS automounter was not designed to:
        <br> provide a way to offer the same namespace to a set of systems.
        <br> provide a way to mount all remote resources when the system boots up.
        <br> mount remote resources on demand.
        <br> minimize the number of actively mounted remote resources on a system.
</li><li> Which of the following is not a condition for deadlock?
        <br> Hold &amp; wait: processes that hold resources can wait for another one.
        <br> Non-agreement: two or more processes cannot agree on resource allocation.
        <br> Non-preemption: a resource cannot be revoked from a process that has it.
        <br> Circular wait: two or more processes are waiting for resources held by one of the others.
</li><li> Which set of events is concurrent (all events are concurrent with each other)?
        <br> (3, 1, 5, 7), (3, 2, 6, 7), (2, 1, 6, 8)
        <br> (2, 1, 3, 4), (2, 2, 3, 3), (3, 3, 2, 5)
        <br> (1, 2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4, 5), (3, 4, 5, 6)
        <br> (1, 5, 6, 7), (1, 4, 5, 7), (1, 3, 2, 2)
</li><li> After the first phase of a two-phase commit protocol, the coordinator:
        <br> sent out a query asking whether the cohorts are ready to commit.
        <br> received responses to the query from all cohorts.
        <br> sent a request to commit (or abort) but did not receive acknowledgements.
        <br> received acknowledgements to the commit (or abort) directive.
</li><li> A linear compensating function adjusts a clock to:
        <br> tick at constantly decreasing or increasing intervals until synchronization is achieved.
        <br> compensate for variations in a clock's frequency to make it appear to tick at a constant rate. 
        <br> tick at a constant faster or slower interval.
        <br> compensate for sudden changes such as leap seconds and daylight saving time.
</li><li> A client gets a timestamp of 4:12:30.500 from a time server.
The elapsed time between the request and response was 20 msec (0.020
sec). The current time on the client is 4:12:30.510. Using Cristian's
algorithm, what is the time set to on the client? <br> 4:12:30.480
        <br> 4:12:30.490
        <br> 4:12:30.510
        <br> 4:12:30.520
</li><li> Which mutual exclusion algorithm is useful when the membership of the group is unknown?
        <br> Centralized.
        <br> Lamport's. 
        <br> Token ring.
        <br> All of these algorithms require knowledge of all group members.
</li><li> How does IP multicast achieve reliable packet delivery?
        <br> It doesn't.
        <br> Via best-effort multicast.
        <br> Via atomic multicast.
        <br> Via IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol).
</li><li> A copyset is used:
        <br> in a DSM system that employs page caching.
        <br> in a DSM system as an alternative to page caching.
        <br> to implement lazy release consistency.
        <br> to implement entry consistency.
</li><li> Weak consistency models do not allow:
        <br> read-write operations to the same memory location to be reordered.
        <br> read-write operations to different memory locations to be reordered
        <br> delayed writes to cached copies of pages.
        <br> cached copies of shared memory pages.
