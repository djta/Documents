<h1>Distributed Systems</h1>
<h2>Exam 3 Spring 2005</h2>
<ol>
<h1>Part I - 30 points</h1>

<li> 8 points<br>
Alice needs to validate that Bob has the same secret key that she
has. How can she do this using symmetric cryptography and no third
party?


</li><li>8 points <br>
Alice needs to create a session key and give it to Bob securely.
How can she do this using public-key cryptography and no third
party?


</li><li>7 points<br>
Why would you encrypt a message with a <i>private key</i>? If this operation does not make sense, explain.


</li><li>7 points<br>
Why would you encrypt a message with a <i>public key</i>? If this operation does not make sense, explain.

<h1>Part II - 70 points</h1>

For each statement, select the <i>most</i> appropriate answer.

</li><li> A rotor machine is an example of a:
        <br>(a) monoalphabetic cipher.
        <br>(b) polyalphabetic cipher.
        <br>(c) transposition cipher.
        <br>(d) hybrid cipher.

</li><li> If a DES key is 56 bits long, a triple-DES key cannot be:
        <br>(a) 56 bits
        <br>(b) 112 bits
        <br>(c) 168 bits
        <br>(d) 224 bits

</li><li> Which of these is most useful in generating a digital signature?
        <br>(a) Hash function
        <br>(b) Session key
        <br>(c) Random number
        <br>(d) Conversation key

</li><li> If it takes you one hour to crack a 56-bit key via a brute-force attack, how long would it take you to crack a 64-bit key?
        <br>(a) 8 hours
        <br>(b) 256 hours
        <br>(c) 8,192 hours
        <br>(d) 4.7*10<sup>21</sup> hours

</li><li> Which authentication technique is not vulnerable to a replay attack?
        <br>(a) Challenge-response
        <br>(b) Biometric
        <br>(c) Multi-factor
        <br>(d) Password

</li><li> Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) relies on:
        <br>(a) physical redundancy.
        <br>(b) information redundancy.
        <br>(c) time redundancy.
        <br>(d) software redundancy.

</li><li> Buffer overflow attacks can be avoided by:
        <br>(a) using signed software.
        <br>(b) using a packet filter.
        <br>(c) disabling execute permission on memory pages.
        <br>(d) conversing over a secure sockets layer (SSL).

</li><li> A heartbeat network:
        <br>(a) allows machines in a cluster to operate in lockstep synchronization.
        <br>(b) synchronizes data flow between machines.
        <br>(c) is a high-speed, low-latency network for communication within the cluster.
        <br>(d) distinguishes machine faults from network faults.

</li><li> A packet filter cannot handle this request:
        <br>(a) Do not any machines from Rutgers to access my network.
        <br>(b) Allow any machine from the outside to access only my smtp mail server and only port 25.
        <br>(c) Disallow any mail from pxk@cs.rutgers.edu to my smtp mail server.
        <br>(d) Disallow any external addresses that masquerade as coming from my network.

</li><li> What machines belong in a demilitarized zone (DMZ)?
        <br>(a) Machines providing services on the Internet.
        <br>(b) Machines that need to access the Internet but should not be accessible from the Internet.
        <br>(c) Malicious and untrusted machines.
        <br>(d) Machines that need to be completely isolated from the Internet.

</li><li> Timestamp ordering ensures that a transaction (process) will not access files that have been accessed by:
        <br>(a) younger transactions that have not committed.
        <br>(b) older transactions that have committed.
        <br>(c) younger transactions that have committed.
        <br>(d) older transactions that have not committed.

</li><li> Alice wants to talk to Bob. When Alice receives a ticket from Kerberos, it:
        <br>(a) is encrypted with Alice's key so that she can extract the session key.
        <br>(b) is encrypted with Bob's key so that Bob can extract the session key.
        <br>(c) is encrypted with a shared key so that both Bob and Alice can extract the session key.
        <br>(d) contains a timestamp to avoid replay attacks.

</li><li> An X.509 digital certificate does not contain:
        <br>(a) a validity time period.
        <br>(b) an encrypted hash.
        <br>(c) a version.
        <br>(d) the certificate owner's private key.
