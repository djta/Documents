<th> DMZ network </th>
<th> Internal network</th>
</tr>

<td> &nbsp; </td>
</tr>

There is, no doubt, something that you have studied and is not on
this exam. Come up with a question that you feel would be appropriate
for this exam and answer it.

Answer:
</li>

<h1>
PART II - 64 points - 4 points each </h1>
<p>
For each statement, select the most appropriate answer.
</p>

<li> Differing from simple resource locking, two-phase locking:
        <br>(a) allows two processes to negotiate for a lock.
        <br>(b) ensures reliable locking by having all members acknowledge the lock request.
        <br>(c) uses a write-ahead log.
        <br>(d) ensures that the effect of serial execution is preserved.

</li><li> In contrast to two-phase locking, strict two-phase locking:
        <br>(a) has a well-defined growing phase and a shrinking phase.
        <br>(b) sends a lock request to all cohorts and does not proceed until it gets all responses.
        <br>(c) relies on a centralized lock manager.
        <br>(d) avoids cascading aborts by having a resource hold all locks until the end.

</li><li> TCP/IP deals with fault tolerance through:
        <br>(a) information redundancy.
        <br>(b) physical redundancy.
        <br>(c) triple modular redundancy.
        <br>(d) time redundancy.

</li><li> To handle the fail-silent failure of one component in a k component system, you need:
        <br>(a) k - 1 components.
        <br>(b) (k + 1) 2 components.
        <br>(c) k2 components.
        <br>(d) k+1 components.

</li><li> SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) achieves authentication using a technique in common with:
        <br>(a) Password authentication.
        <br>(b) Skey authentication.
        <br>(c) SecurID tokens.
        <br>(d) SKID2/SKID3.

</li><li> Alice wants to talk with Bob and uses Kerberos authentication. The sealed envelope she gets is:
        <br>(a) encrypted with Bob's secret key.
        <br>(b) encrypted with Alice's secret key.
        <br>(c) encrypted with the session key.
        <br>(d) encrypted with Bob's public key.

</li><li> An X.509 digital certificate contains:
        <br>(a) a user's public key encrypted with the certification authority's private key.
        <br>(b) a user's unencrypted public key signed with the certification authority's private key.
        <br>(c) a user's unencrypted public key and private key encrypted with the certification authority's private key.
        <br>(d) a user's private key encrypted with the certification authority's public key.

</li><li> CAPTCHA is used to:
        <br>(a) normalize a user's biometric to facilitate pattern matching.
        <br>(b) authenticate a user and establish a session key.
        <br>(c) authenticate a specific user.
        <br>(d) identify a user as a human being.

</li><li> Relying on an intruder's inability to validate a digital signature is the basis of:
        <br>(a) CAPTCHA.
        <br>(b) a null cipher.
        <br>(c) chaffing and winnowing.
        <br>(d) digital certificates.

</li><li> A stateful packet inspecting firewall is needed to guard against:
        <br>(a) someone trying to connect to the web server port on your mail server system.
        <br>(b) SYN flooding attacks within your network.
        <br>(c) incorrect HTTP requests that are attempts to compromise your web server.
        <br>(d) packets from the outside that are masqueraded to appear as if they're from local machines.

</li><li> The main idea behind IP tunneling is:
        <br>(a) rewriting source and destination addresses in an IP header.
        <br>(b) encrypting the data of an IP packet.
        <br>(c) encapsulating IP packets within other IP packets.
        <br>(d) redirecting IP traffic to a different port number.

</li><li> An application restart from a checkpointed state is known as a:
        <br>(a) cold failover.
        <br>(b) warm failover.
        <br>(c) hot failover.
        <br>(d) cascading failover.

</li><li> Load balancing is not useful for:
        <br>(a) planned outage management.
        <br>(b) application failover.
        <br>(c) fault tolerance.
        <br>(d) increased performance.

</li><li> A ROC plot for a biometric device helps you:
        <br>(a) assess the accuracy of using the biometric for authentication.
        <br>(b) identify the trade-off of robustness versus distinctiveness.
        <br>(c) identify the trade-off of time versus pattern matching performance.
        <br>(d) see how many iterations of signal processing are needed to achieve a good match.

</li><li> A rootkit is:
        <br>(a) designed to hide files or modify the behavior of an operating system.
        <br>(b) a comprehensive set of hacker tools to allow one to try to get access to a system.
        <br>(c)
a program that exploits a bug in the operating system or in an
application that gives you administrative access (root) on a system. <br>(d) software that detects malicious software on your system.

</li><li> A hypervisor does not:
        <br>(a) receive system interrupts.
        <br>(b) translate system calls from user programs to ones that make sense on the host operating system.
        <br>(c) control access to the memory management unit.
        <br>(d) intercept privileged instructions.
