<h2>Exam 3 Spring 2008</h2>
<ol>
<h1>Part I - 30 Points</h1>

<li> 6 points<br>
What are the three factors of authentication?
</li>

<li> 6 points <br>
When you request a service via Kerberos, you are presented with a
ticket. What does this ticket contain and how is it used?
</li>

<li> 6 points <br>
How would you check that a digital certificate is valid? Specifically,
explain how you ensure that it (a) has not been modified and (b)
is really issued by the party that claims to have created it?
</li>

<li> 6 points <br>
How does the steganographic technique of chaffing and winnowing use
digital signatures?
</li>

<li> 6 points <br>
Is the following statement true or false? Explain and defend your position.
<br>
<em>
Application proxies were once useful but have been rendered obsolete
with the introduction of SPI (stateful packet inspection) firewalls as
successors to packet filters.
</em>
</li>

</p>

<li> MS-CHAP, Microsoft's Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol is most similar to:
        <br>(a) Challenge-Response.
        <br>(b) RSA SecurID.
        <br>(c) Password Authentication Protocol (PAP).
        <br>(d) SKID.

</li><li> Which of these authentication protocols is most vulnerable on insecure networks?
        <br>(a) CHAP (challenge handshake authentication protocol).
        <br>(b) PAP (password authentication protocol).
        <br>(c) SecurID (SASL).
        <br>(d) Kerberos.

</li><li> A digital certificate contains:
        <br>(a) a signed public key.
        <br>(b) a signed public key and encrypted private key.
        <br>(c) an encrypted private key.
        <br>(d) a signed private key.

</li><li> How does SSL establish an encryption key between the client and server?
        <br>(a) The client picks the key, encrypts it with the server's public key, and sends it to the server.
        <br>(b)
Each machine uses the other's public key: the client encrypts data with
the server's public key and the server encrypts data with the client's
public key. <br>(c) Diffie-Hellman key exchange allows the client and server to come up with a common key.
        <br>(d) A trusted third party employing the wide-mouth frog protocol is used.

</li><li> CAPTCHA relies on
        <br>(a) presenting the user with a series of questions.
        <br>(b) a combination of biometrics and public key cryptography.
        <br>(c) having the user prove that he/she has the correct key.
        <br>(d) human pattern recognition.

</li><li> Which authentication scheme does not use a nonce for authentication?
        <br>(a) Challenge-Response.
        <br>(b) SKID.
        <br>(c) Kerberos.
        <br>(d) SSL.

</li><li> SecurID is vulnerable to:
        <br>(a) man in the middle attacks.
        <br>(b) dictionary attacks.
        <br>(c) known plaintext attacks.
        <br>(d) replay attacks.

</li><li> A packet filtering firewall cannot:
        <br>(a) block packets from the Internet whose source address is masqueraded to appear as if it is from your internal network.
        <br>(b) allow TCP/IP packets to port 25 on your mail server and disallow all other packets.
        <br>(c) block attempts to create a buffer overflow attack to the mail server.
        <br>(d) block all UDP/IP packets from the network 128.6.0.0/16.

</li><li> TCP/IP uses the following for fault tolerance:
        <br>(a) heartbeat network.
        <br>(b) information redundancy.
        <br>(c) time  redundancy.
        <br>(d) physical redundancy.

</li><li> RAID 5 (disk parity) uses the following for fault tolerance:
        <br>(a) heartbeat network.
        <br>(b) information redundancy.
        <br>(c) time  redundancy.
        <br>(d) physical redundancy.

</li><li> RAID 1 (disk mirroring) uses the following for fault tolerance:
        <br>(a) heartbeat network.
        <br>(b) information redundancy.
        <br>(c) time  redundancy.
        <br>(d) physical redundancy.

</li><li> SYN flooding will cause a machine to:
        <br>(a) go out of service.
        <br>(b) not be able to accept any more incoming IP packets.
        <br>(c) not be able to accept any more TCP/IP connections.
        <br>(d) not be able to accept any more TCP/IP connections on a specific port.

</li><li> The two army problem guarantees that two users with an unreliable communication stream between them can achieve agreement:
        <br>(a) by sending a message and receiving an acknowledgement.
        <br>(b) by a three-way handshake: send a message, receive an acknowledgement, and then acknowledge that acknowledgement.
        <br>(c) by applying error-correcting codes to the message.
        <br>(d) never.

</li><li> An hypervisor would not:
        <br>(a) allow multiple operating systems to run concurrently on one processor.
        <br>(b) detect the installation of a rootkit within the operating system.
        <br>(c) control the processor's memory management unit (MMU).
        <br>(d) intercept privileged processor instructions that would normally go to the operating system.

</li><li> The main difference between a grid and a conventional HPC cluster is that a grid:
        <br>(a) offers fault tolerance as well as high performance.
        <br>(b) requires all machines to have the same operating system.
        <br>(c) can be thought of as a virtual cluster instead of using machines dedicated to the cluster.
        <br>(d) does not require processes to communicate with each other.
