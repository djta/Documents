(a) How is a nonce used for authentication in public-key cryptography? Give a simple example of Alice authenticating Bob. <br>
(b) How is a nonce used for authentication in symmetric cryptography? Give a simple example of Alice authenticating Bob. <br>

</li><li> 6 points <br>
What is the purpose of a ticket (sealed envelope) in Kerberos?

</li><li> 6 points <br>
How do you use an X.509 digital certificate to validate signed software?

</li><li> 6 points <br>
Northrup Grumman developed a mobile electronic fingerprinting system
for use by the UK police. A search of 6.6 million prints takes under
five minutes. An index into a database of 6.6 million records generally
takes only a few milliseconds. Why does the fingerprint search take so
long?
<h1>PART II - 76 points </h1>
For each statement, select the most appropriate answer.

</li><li>  Strict two-phase locking differs from two-phase locking in that it:
        <br> (a) Relies on atomic multicasts.
        <br> (b) Ensures that other transactions do not have to abort because they read data that was modified.
        <br> (c) Has a shrinking phase that does not start until the growing phase is complete.
        <br> (d) Requires mandatory locks rather than advisory locks.

</li><li>  Optimistic concurrency control schemes do not assume:
        <br> (a) All data that may potentially be used by a transaction should be locked.
        <br> (b) Transactions are likely to complete and not abort from accessing resources out of order.
        <br> (c) Locking is not necessary because the chance of transactions accessing the same data is low.
        <br>
(d) It is more efficient to put effort into restoring data from aborted
transactions than to keep it from getting corrupt in the first place. </li><li>  TCP/IP achieves fault tolerance through:
        <br> (a) Information redundancy.
        <br> (b) Time redundancy.
        <br> (c) Physical redundancy.
        <br> (d) Triple modular redundancy.
        
</li><li>  A k-fault-tolerant system (one that withstands k faults) with fail-silent faults requires:
        <br> (a) k+1 components.
        <br> (b) 2k+1 components.
        <br> (c) k<sup>2</sup> components.
        <br> (d) k<sup>2</sup>+1 components.
        
</li><li>  A k-fault-tolerant system (one that withstands k faults) with Byzantine faults requires:
        <br> (a) k+1 components.
        <br> (b) 2k+1 components.
        <br> (c) k<sup>2</sup> components.
        <br> (d) k<sup>2</sup>+1 components.
        
</li><li>  A challenge/response authentication system uses:
        <br> (a) Your PIN, a seed/password on the authenticator device, and a value from the remote system.
        <br> (b) Your PIN, a seed/password on the authenticator device, and the time of day.
        <br> (c) Your PIN and a seed/password on the authenticator device.
        <br> (d) A seed/password on the authenticator device and the time of day.
        
</li><li>  An X.509 digital certificate contains:
        <br> (a) Your public key and your encrypted private key.
        <br> (b) Your public key and the certificate issuer's public key.
        <br> (c) Your public key and your digital signature.
        <br> (d) Your public key and the certificate issuer's digital signature.
        
</li><li>  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL or TLS) is an example of:
        <br> (a) A public-key cryptosystem.
        <br> (b) A symmetric cryptosystem.
        <br> (c) A hybrid cryptosystem.
        <br> (d) A restricted cryptosystem.
        
</li><li>  A null cipher is:
        <br> (a) A cipher that does no encryption, used for testing protocols.
        <br> (b) A cipher that uses an empty key, essentially a restricted cipher.
        <br> (c) A technique for transposing data to make it unintelligible.
        <br> (d) A technique for hiding a message inside irrelevant data.
        
</li><li>  Extracting a message that is hidden with chaffing and winnowing requires:
        <br> (a) Being able to validate a signature on a message.
        <br> (b) A brute force attack to extract the key.
        <br> (c) Figuring out the pattern of good and bad messages.
        <br> (d) Being able to decrypt the message.
        
</li><li>  To allow traffic to your web server (port 80) but not your mail server (port 25), you need:

        <br> (d) Secure systems inside an organization, such as logging servers and backup servers.
