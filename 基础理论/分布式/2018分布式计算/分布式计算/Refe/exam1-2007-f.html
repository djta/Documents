<h1>Part I - 30 Points</h1>

<li> 5 points<br>
What problem was a snoopy cache designed to solve (compared to a
regular processor cache)?
</li>

<li> 5 points <br>
Your network requires the ability to address 500 hosts. A class B
network, with a 16-bit host address, has the ability to address
65,534 hosts. 55,034 potential addresses are hence wasted. Will
using CIDR instead of a class B address help? Explain how or, if
not, explain why not.

</li><li> 5 points <br>
Most RPC systems require an interface definition language. Explain
the purpose of an IDL.

</li><li> 5 points <br>
Explain what is meant by marshaling and unmarshaling in the context
of remote procedure calls.

</li><li> 5 points <br>
Contrast the approach to caching in AFS to that in NFS.

</li><li> 5 points <br>
AFS is a stateful file system. What state does the server have to maintain?

<h1>
PART II - 70 points </h1>
<p>
For each statement, select the most appropriate answer.
</p>
</li><li> A vector (or array) processor is an example of the following architecture:
        <br>(a) Processor pool.
        <br>(b) NUMA (non-uniform memory access).
        <br>(c) SMP (symmetric multiprocessors).
        <br>(d) SIMD (single instruction, multiple data).

</li><li> The fastest memory interconnect for a massively parallel multiprocessor system is:
        <br>(a) system bus.
        <br>(b) crossbar switch.
        <br>(c) omega network.
        <br>(d) NUMA (non-uniform memory access).

</li><li> Compared to a baseband network, a broadband network:
        <br>(a) offers more bandwidth.
        <br>(b) offers lower latency.
        <br>(c) allows multiple data streams to be sent at the same time.
        <br>(d) is better suited to home networking.

</li><li> Sending a packet on an ethernet network relies on:
        <br>(a) waiting for the network to be free, sending the packet, and then checking for a collision.
        <br>(b) avoiding collisions by ensuring that only one node transmits at a time.
        <br>(c) assigning specific time slots during which each node is allowed to transmit.
        <br>(d) assigning each node a unique frequency for transmitting data.

</li><li> Which layer of the OSI reference model do TCP and UDP occupy?
        <br>(a) UDP: network layer (3); TCP: transport layer (4).
        <br>(b) UDP: transport layer (4); TCP: transport layer (4).
        <br>(c) UDP: network layer (3); TCP: network layer (3).
        <br>(d) UDP: transport layer (4); TCP: network layer (3).

</li><li> ARP, the Address Resolution Protocol:
        <br>(a) resolves conflicts if two devices have the same IP address.
        <br>(b) resolves conflicts if two devices have the same ethernet address.
        <br>(c) finds the IP address for a given ethernet address.
        <br>(d) finds the ethernet address for a given IP address.

</li><li> UDP:
        <br>(a) ensures that packets arrive in the same order they were transmitted.
        <br>(b) retransmits lost packets.
        <br>(c) drops packets with corrupt data.
        <br>(d) none of the above.

</li><li> Which sequence of system calls establishes a connection-oriented socket, names it, sets it for 
receiving connections, and waits for an incoming connection?
        <br>(a) connect, bind, listen, accept.
        <br>(b) socket, bind, recv, accept.
        <br>(c) connect, biund, recv, listen.
        <br>(d) socket, bind, listen, accept.

</li><li> Nagle's algorithm:
        <br>(a) allows a programmer to set bits in an IP header to request a certain level of service.
        <br>(b) groups related flows of IP packets together at the router.
        <br>(c) avoids sending lots of small TCP packets.
        <br>(d) retransmits IP packets at increasing intervals to relieve network congestion.

</li><li> ATM is most accurately described as a network that:
        <br>(a) employs hard QoS to switch a stream of variable-size packets.
        <br>(b) employs hard QoS to switch a stream of fixed-size packets.
        <br>(c) employs soft QoS to switch a stream of variable-size packets.
        <br>(d) employs soft QoS to switch a stream of fixed-size packets.

</li><li> DCE RPC improved on SUN (ONC) RPC by adding:
        <br>(a) an interface definition language.
        <br>(b) a cell directory server.
        <br>(c) an interface pointer to support objects.
        <br>(d) dynamic selection of TCP or UDP.

</li><li> Which of the following best describes the distinction between a name and an address?
        <br>(a) A name is human-friendly; an address is machine-friendly.
        <br>(b) An address is unique; a name does not have to be unique.
        <br>(c) An address is a location associated with the name.
        <br>(d) A name is alphanumeric; an address is numeric.

</li><li> Which is the least accurate statement about SOAP?
        <br>(a) SOAP is a highly-compact way of representing procedure calls.
        <br>(b) SOAP passes through content-inspecting firewalls by using HTTP.
        <br>(c) SOAP uses explicit typing in an XML structure.
        <br>(d) SOAP integrates with Microsoft .NET remoting.

</li><li> Compared with sequential semantics, session semantics:
        <br>(a) usually require more network messages.
        <br>(b) make file locking impossible.
        <br>(c) make concurrent modifications impossible.
        <br>(d) make it difficult to do client-side caching.
