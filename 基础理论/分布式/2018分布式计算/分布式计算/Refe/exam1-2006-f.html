<h1> Distributed Systems </h1>
<h2> Exam 1 - Fall 2006</h2>

<ol>
<h1>Part I - 40 Points</h1>

<li> 5 points<br>
The IP address 192.168.2.101 can be treated as either a name or an address. Explain.


</li><li>6 points <br>
Why would a snoopy cache not work on a switched interconnect?


</li><li>5 points<br>
What is meant by a single system image ?


</li><li>6 points<br>
Why is the transport layer crucial to client-server programming and working at the network layer alone is insufficient?


</li><li>6 points<br>
The Domain Name System is built as a collection of DNS servers. How
does a client know how to consult the server that holds the
name-to-address mapping it needs?
</li><li>6 points<br>Explain the function of client and server stubs
in remote procedure calls and how both are crucial to making remote
procedure calls appear like local procedure calls.
</li><li>6 points<br>
(a) How does a machine find the ethernet address corresponding to its IP address (using ARP)?
<br>(b) How is this a security vulnerability?


<h1>Part II - 75 Points</h1>

For each statement, select the <i>most</i> appropriate answer.

</li><li> Multiprocessor systems are characterized by:
        <br>(a) Shared memory.
        <br>(b) No shared memory.
        <br>(c) A local area network.
        <br>(d) Cache memory.

</li><li> Unlike a baseband network, a broadband network:
        <br>(a) Allows two or more messages to be transmitted simultaneously.
        <br>(b) Requires less complex hardware.
        <br>(c) Can support both video and audio.
        <br>(d) Allows the use of the full bandwidth of the network.

</li><li> A class B IP network can address up to 65,534 hosts. A class
C IP network can address up to 254 hosts. Which of the following
network sizes (number of hosts) will benefit from CIDR? <br>(a) 130
        <br>(b) 33,000
        <br>(c) 125
        <br>(d) 61,200

</li><li> TCP simulates a circuit-switched protocol but does not provide the following feature:
        <br>(a) In-order packet delivery.
        <br>(b) Constant latency.
        <br>(c) Reliable packet delivery.
        <br>(d) Byte-stream communications.

</li><li> Which of the following mechanisms provides hard QoS (quality of service) in IP networks?
        <br>(a) Nagle's algorithm.
        <br>(b) RSVP (ReSerVation Protocol).
        <br>(c) Differentiated Services.
        <br>(d) Flow detection.

</li><li> Differing from Java RMI, Microsoft DCOM's garbage collection:
        <br>(a) Supports reference counting on the server.
        <br>(b) Has a server timeout where the server cleans up client resources.
        <br>(c) Does not have a server timeout where the server cleans up client resources.
        <br>(d) Allows a client to identify in-use objects.

</li><li> The portmapper under Sun RPC:
        <br>(a) Is responsible for assigning port numbers to RPC services.
        <br>(b) Allows RPC to work with Port Address Translation (PAT).
        <br>(c) Is a name server for clients to find the port number for a specific RPC service.
        <br>(d) All of the above.

</li><li> DCE RPC added the following to Sun RPC:
        <br>(a) An interface definition language.
        <br>(b) An interface pointer identifier for object references.
        <br>(c) A format for representing marshaled data over a network.
        <br>(d) A name server that allows a client to find out which machine a service is running on.

</li><li> Which of the following is not true about SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):
        <br>(a) It uses XML.
        <br>(b) It provides a format for marshaling procedure calls and their parameters.
        <br>(c) It uses compact implicit typing.
        <br>(d) It was designed to be firewall-friendly and pass through HTTP gateways.

</li><li> UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is an example of which layer of the OSI protocol stack?
        <br>(a) Data Link (2).
        <br>(b) Network (3).
        <br>(c) Transport (4).
        <br>(d) Presentation (5).

</li><li> A snoopy cache reduces bus traffic for:
        <br>(a) Memory read operations.
        <br>(b) Both memory read and write operations.
        <br>(c) Memory write operations.
        <br>(d) Neither memory read nor write operations.

</li><li> Which of the following addresses belongs to the network 192.168.4.0/22?
        <br>(a) 192.128.4.1
        <br>(b) 192.168.3.15
        <br>(c) 192.168.7.12
        <br>(d) 192.168.8.1
