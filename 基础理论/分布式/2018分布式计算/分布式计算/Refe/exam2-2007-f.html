<ol>
<h1>Part I - 36 Points</h1>

<li> 5 points<br>
How does a replicated Coda server discover that it has out-of-date files?
</li>

<li> 9 points <br>
Suppose the round-trip delay of sending a message to a time server and getting a response back is <i>R</i>.
The time value returned by the server is <i>T<sub>S</sub></i>.
The time at the client when it sent the request is <i>T<sub>C</sub></i>. 
<br>
(a) Express the formula for the new time on the client, <i>T</i>, using
Cristian's algorithm.
<blockquote>
        <i>T</i> = 
</blockquote>

(b) If the best-case round-trip delay to the server is <i>T<sub>B</sub></i> and the error of the clock
on the server is &plusmn;<i>E<sub>S</sub></i>. What is the error on the client after it synchronizes its clock with the server?
<blockquote>
        <i>E</i> = &plusmn;
</blockquote>
</li>

<li> 5 points <br>
Vector timestamps assume that every participating process knows the
group membership from the start. A new process cannot just jump in
and send a message to anyone in the group. Propose a modified
algorithm that does not require <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the group.
Specifically, explain how a timestamp is defined and what happens
when a message arrives from a previously unseen process. [Hint:
don't use a central coordinator.]
</li>

<li> 7 points <br>
(a) Prove that a cryptographic hash function, no matter how good, will always be vulnerable to collisions.
<br>
(b) Why is this not a huge concern?
</li>

<li> 5 points <br>
What is the purpose of the client modification log in Coda?
</li>

<li> 10 points <br>
(a) How can Alice generate a digital signature for a message that anybody can validate?
<br>
(b) How can Alice generate a digital signature for a message that only Bob can validate?
</li>

<li> 8 points <br>
(a) How can Alice pass a symmetric key securely to Bob using only symmetric cryptography and a trusted third party (Trent)?
<br>
(b) How can Alice pass a symmetric key securely to Bob using public key cryptography?
</li>

</li><li> An <i>oplock</i>, or <i>opportunistic lock</i>, in CIFS is:
        <br>(a) Requested by a client to ensure that it gets exclusive access to a region of the file.
        <br>(b) Granted by the server and tells the client how it may cache file data.
        <br>(c) Requested by the client to share a region of a file with another client.
        <br>(d)

opportunity arises, even if the process has to wait to get the lock.
</li><li> Berkeley's xFS project demonstrates that:
        <br>(a) A distributed file system can be built on a serverless peer-to-peer infrastructure.
